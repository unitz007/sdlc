# Project Purpose

## Vision
SDLC is a lightweight CLI tool that unifies software development lifecycle commands (run, test, build) across different project types. It abstracts away the specific build tool commands, allowing developers to use a consistent interface regardless of the language or framework.

## Audience
Developers who work with multiple languages and frameworks and want a consistent workflow.

## Quality Bar
- **Reliability**: Commands must execute reliably and errors should be reported clearly.
- **Performance**: The tool should be fast and have minimal overhead.
- **Usability**: The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, idiomatic Go, and well-tested.
